Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 (R8000)
===================================

I had `a Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 tri-band router (model R8000) <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KWHMR6G?tag=mhsvortex>`_ as my primary router/wireless access point coming right off the cable modem for quite some time.

I replaced it with :doc:`Ubiquiti equipment <../network/ubiquiti>` when we had some networking hiccups.

I bought this as a replacement for the :doc:`Netgear WNDR3700v2 <netgearwndr3700v2>` I was using due to some range issues. I had wireless roaming mostly working, though it wasn't smooth, so I upgraded to this model to help out. I liked my :doc:`Netgear WNDR3700v2 <netgearwndr3700v2>` and it was solid; I just needed some better range.

The trouble in the house is mostly walls. No matter where I put my previous access points, nothing really covered everywhere. With this new router, I get a minimum of three bars (out of four) everywhere in my house and even into the back yard.

Setup was super easy and the additional features like Dynamic Quality of Service are sweet. I had the new router swapped out for my old one and everything configured in under an hour.
