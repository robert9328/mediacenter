======================
Insignia NS-43D420NA20
======================

When the :doc:`Sharp Aquos TV <../deprecated/sharpaquoslc37d7u>` died, I picked up this Insignia as a replacement TV for the garage.

In this case, price was the primary driver rather than high performance or great picture or whatever. It was intended to be a "garage TV" so if the sawdust gets to it or it doesn't like the temperature changes, it's not going to matter much when it dies.

It's not even worth including a picture of this thing. It's a generic flat-screen TV. You get the idea.
