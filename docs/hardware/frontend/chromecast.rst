I wasn't too into Google Chromecast early on (first gen?) when I first got one because it had a lot of trouble with networking.

The `Chromecast with Google TV <https://amzn.to/3TmRivV>`_, though, is amazing, and I have a couple of those. They have replaced our :doc:`Roku <roku>` devices in most cases, but we still have a Roku floating around just in case we want to watch the Roku Channel or something.

The :doc:`NVIDIA Shield TV <nvidiashield>` has Chromecast and Google TV built in, too.
