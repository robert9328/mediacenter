Xbox One X
==========

In February 2023 I upgraded to the Xbox One X because several games I was interested in were only coming out for the latest generation consoles. This became the primary Xbox in the living room.

Xbox One
========

I was late to the Xbox One game, waiting until a year or so after it was released before jumping in.

When we upgraded to the :doc:`Samsung UN65KS8000 <../tv/samsungun65ks8000>` I got the `Xbox One Gears of War 4 Limited 2TB bundle <https://amzn.to/2oaHE0z>`_ to go along with the 4K support on the TV.

Xbox 360
========

I have two `Xbox 360 units <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NNU07RU?tag=mhsvortex>`_. I also have one of the HD-DVD players (yeah, I know).

You have to hook it up in a particular way if you want to get HD video out of it, especially through HD-DVD.

- For HD-DVD 1080p signal, you have to output from Xbox using VGA. The trouble is that **most TVs don't accept incoming VGA or DVI signals greater than 720p**. (This is also relevant when talking about how we hook up :doc:`Windows Media Center <../../software/deprecated/windowsmediacenter>`.) Using component cables, you can get 1080i at best.
- Not sure if you can get HD-DVD 1080p through the HDMI output adapter, but several games support 1080p through it.

We got a second Xbox - the new one is downstairs and connects via HDMI to :doc:`the Samsung TV <../tv/samsungln52a750>`, the old one went upstairs.

- It looks like all of the Xbox models since July 2007 have HDMI, but you need to have a separate cable to enable the sound output when using HDMI. Only the Elite Xbox comes with that. Separately it costs ~$45. `It appears that the Arcade machine has HDMI. <https://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/x/xbox360arcadesystem/>`_ Arcade is not backwards-compatible with Xbox legacy games, but that could be just because it doesn't have a hard drive.
- I ended up getting an Xbox 360 Arcade from Dell, an Xbox HDMI cable/adapter and wireless network adapter from Amazon, and a 512MB memory card from Best Buy. I put the Xbox 360 Arcade with all that downstairs. I stuck the old hard drive on the Xbox 360 Arcade and that works well. Our gamer profiles are each on memory cards - Jenn on the 64MB card I already had and me on the 512MB card I bought. The original Xbox 360 was moved upstairs to the game room.

I got a `Turtle Beach Ear Force X4 <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V7N54A?tag=mhsvortex>`_ headset for Christmas and put it downstairs so I could play games without disturbing folks. Very nice headset. Rechargeable AAA batteries are a must with it.
