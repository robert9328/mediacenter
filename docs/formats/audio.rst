Audio Formats

Apple Lossless (ALAC / M4A)
===========================
My primary audio format of choice is `Apple Lossless <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless>`_.

I went with ALAC for a few reasons:

- I prefer a lossless format for my music so I can convert it as needed and always have "the original." MP3 format is lossy, and while I'm not an audiophile, if I have a lossless version I can always convert it to a lossy compression. You can't go the other way.
- My primary music playing portable device is an iPod.
- I manage my music in :doc:`iTunes <../software/manage/itunes>`.
- Most media servers like :doc:`Asset UPnP <../software/serve/asset>` can transcode ALAC to other formats.

The other big format in lossless is `FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC>`_, and while it's reasonably popular from a format perspective, pretty much nothing plays it.

Apple Lossless uses `an MP4 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_3>`_ *container* just like AAC format.

MPEG Layer III (MP3)
====================
These are `the MP3s <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3>`_ you know and love.

This is a great format for its compatibility and lack of DRM. I primarily get these at `Amazon Digital Music <https://www.amazon.com/MP3-Music-Download/b?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0&node=163856011&redirected=1&tag=mhsvortex>`_.

Given the choice between an MP3 album and the CD, all things being equal, I'll take the CD and rip it to ALAC before buying the MP3 album. Again, I can always convert down, but can't convert back up.

Advanced Audio Coding (AAC / M4A)
=================================
When I first started ripping my CDs into digital files, I went with a 256Kbps `AAC/MP4 format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding>`_. AAC has a better sound for the compression than MP3 and I figured this would be a good compromise between size and fidelity.

Then I got my :doc:`HP Home Server <../hardware/deprecated/hpex475>` with a ton of space and realized *I should have gone with lossless*.

AAC uses `an MP4 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_3>`_ *container* just like ALAC format.
