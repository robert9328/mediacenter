Hulu

We subscribed to `Hulu <https://hulu.com>`_ as part of the :doc:`plan to cut cable in 2015 <../plans/cuttingthecable>`. Combined with the other :doc:`services we subscribe to <index>` this fills the gap in TV content.

The challenge with Hulu is that there are some providers (e.g., `CBS <https://www.cbs.com>`_) that don't put their content on Hulu. Even providers like HBO have deals with *someone* (`Amazon got much of HBO in 2014 <https://www.ew.com/article/2014/04/23/hbo-amazon>`_). I have had to bridge some of that by using over-the-air TV with a :doc:`Tablo DVR <../hardware/server/tablo>`.
